# Knievel Requirements

**Tagline:** Fearlessly fast ad delivery that steals the show.

Knievel is a Rust ad-serving platform inspired by [Kevel](https://dev.kevel.com)'s
domain model, with its own clean OpenAPI-defined wire format. It targets
multi-tenant deployments — one process can host many isolated workspaces —
and ships a generated client library alongside the server so calling apps
speak the API through real types rather than hand-rolled HTTP.

This document is the working spec. Wrong in places — we iterate.

## 1. Goals

1. Deliver a clean OpenAPI 3.1 surface for ad serving + management. The spec
   is the contract; both the Rust server and the generated client libraries
   are derived from it.
2. Native multi-tenancy: one binary serves many isolated Projects without
   per-tenant infrastructure.
3. Sub-millisecond p50 decision latency on a single node.
4. Statically-linked Rust binary + Postgres. No second datastore in v0.
5. A foundation that grows into the broader Kevel feature surface (UserDB,
   geo, frequency capping, auctions, reporting) without rewrites.
6. Minimal operator burden — a small team should be able to run knievel
   without specialized ops staff.

## 2. Non-Goals (v0)

- Kevel wire compatibility. Drop-in compatibility for existing integrations
  is the job of generated client libraries, not the server.
- Browser-direct ad calls. Knievel assumes a trusted server-to-server
  caller in v0; browser-direct is a v1+ deployment mode.
- UserDB / per-user behavioral targeting.
- Geo, IP, lat/long, radius, day-parting, keyword, custom-property
  targeting.
- Frequency capping, eCPM auctions, second-price clearing, pricing data.
- Reporting API surface (callers track from impression/click pings in v0).
- Web admin UI. CLI + API only.
- Header bidding, OpenRTB, DSP/SSP integration.

These are explicitly future work, not "never." See §11.

```

- **Web framework:** [`poem`](https://github.com/poem-web/poem) +
  [`poem-openapi`](https://docs.rs/poem-openapi/). Handlers and request/
  response types are annotated; the OpenAPI spec is generated from the
  binary and exposed at `GET /openapi.json`.
- **Datastore:** Postgres-native, vanilla. Knievel targets a dedicated
  **schema** inside operator-supplied Postgres (Aurora and every other
  major managed variant supported, including Supabase). No required
  Postgres extensions beyond `pgcrypto`. Knievel manages its own
  partitions in-process; see §7.
- **Hot path:** the configuration snapshot lives in process memory, keyed
  by `(project_id, resource)`, refreshed on change notification. Decision
  requests touch RAM only.
- **Event path:** decision/impression/click events are buffered in an
  in-process channel and `COPY`'d to the partitioned events table in
  batches every 1–2 s. Postgres routes rows to the correct partition.
- **Observability:** structured JSON logs via `tracing`, OpenTelemetry
  spans exported via OTLP, pervasive Sentry error reporting. All three
  carry the same `request_id` / `trace_id` for correlation. See §10.
- **Configuration:** layered — built-in defaults, then a `config.yaml`
  file with `${VAR}` env-interpolation, then individual env-var
  overrides. See §10.1.

## 4. Multi-Tenancy

Knievel uses a two-level tenant hierarchy:

- **Organization** — billing entity, user roster, owns API tokens that may
  span its Projects.
- **Project** — an isolated ad-serving workspace. Has its own Advertisers,
  Campaigns, Flights, Ads, Creatives, Sites, Zones, taxonomies. Hard
  isolation between Projects in the same Org.

A single-tenant deployment is just one Org with one Project — the same
shape Kevel calls a "Network."

### 4.1 Common deployment patterns

Knievel supports — and stays ergonomic across — three shapes:

- **Single-project deployment.** One publisher, one Org, one Project. The
  simplest shape; analogous to one Kevel Network.
- **Project-per-environment.** `prod`, `staging`, `dev` as sibling Projects
  under one Org. A single Org token can address all three.
- **Project-per-tenant.** A multi-tenant calling app spins up one Project
  per end customer. Hundreds of small Projects are fine; provisioning is
  a single idempotent API call.

Knievel does not pick one for you.

### 4.2 Integration shape

Knievel is designed for **server-to-server** calls from a trusted upstream
(the calling app). Browsers do not call the Decision API directly in v0;
they only hit the public event endpoints (`/e/...`).

Why proxy-first:

- **Ad-blocker resistance.** Decision requests originate from the calling
  app's own infrastructure, not a known ad-network domain.
- **Server-side enrichment.** The calling app can enrich the request with
  trusted context (auth state, A/B bucket, subscription tier).
- **Caller-driven post-filtering** via `block.creativeIds` / etc., for
  state knievel doesn't model (e.g., "this listing was just unpublished").
- **Simpler auth.** One Bearer token, not per-browser bot filtering +
  signed requests + CORS preflights.

Concretely:

- Decision and Management endpoints take `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Plain `application/json`. No `text/plain` workaround.
- CORS off by default. Browser-direct mode (CORS, anonymous decision,
  bot filtering) is a v1+ feature.
- Impression/click pings are GETs that browsers hit directly; their
  signatures are HMAC-minted at decision time.

### 4.3 Authentication & authorization

Knievel accepts two coexisting credential types on its Management and
Decision endpoints. Per-deployment config picks which are enabled.

| Mode | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Opaque token** | `kvl_<env>_<scope>_<random>` | Minted by knievel, stored argon2id-hashed, revocable. Bootstrap and admin-UI sessions. |
| **JWT** | Standard three-segment JWT | Validated statelessly against issuer JWKS. For deployments with Keycloak / OIDC already in place. |

Detection is by prefix (`kvl_` for opaque, anything else parses as
JWT). Either or both can be enabled simultaneously; cutover from
opaque to JWT is a flag flip.

**Token scopes (both modes):**

- **Org-scoped** — addresses any Project in the Org via
  `/v1/projects/{projectId}/...`. The calling app's primary credential.
- **Project-scoped** — single Project. For per-tenant access (eventual
  admin UI; per-customer integrations).

**Roles:**

| Role | Scope | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| Org Owner | Org | Manage org, billing, projects, members, all tokens. |
| Org Admin | Org | Same minus billing and ownership transfer. |
| Project Admin | Project | Full CRUD on resources; manage project members and tokens. |
| Project Editor | Project | CRUD on Advertisers/Campaigns/Flights/Ads/Creatives/Templates/Sites/Zones. The integration role. |
| Project Reader | Project | `GET` everything in the project, including issuing decisions. |

Org tokens carry a project-level role applied to every project they
address (typically `org-admin` ⇒ Project Admin, or `org-editor` ⇒
Project Editor).

**Opaque token format:** `kvl_<env>_<scope>_<random>` (e.g.
`kvl_prod_org_AbCd_8f2a...`). Stored argon2id-hashed; never
recoverable after creation. Revocable. Last-used timestamp tracked.

**JWT validation:** issuer + audience check, signature verified
against per-issuer JWKS (auto-discovered, cached, `kid`-rotation
aware). Algorithm allow-list rejects `alg: none` and HMAC variants.
Authorization context lives in a `knievel` custom claim (`scope`,
`org_id`, `project_id`, `role`). Multiple issuers supported for
federation.

Full details — JWT claim shape, Keycloak protocol-mapper setup, JWKS
config, mode-coexistence semantics, OIDC-for-humans roadmap — in
`AUTH.md`.

### 4.4 Site Group scoping (roadmap)

A future Site Group entity will let Project members and tokens be scoped
to a subset of Sites within a Project — for cases where multiple
sub-tenants share a Project but should be admin-isolated from each
other. Not v0; called out so the data model leaves room for it.

## 5. Domain Model

```
Organization                                  ← billing, users
  ├── AdLibrary                                ← reusable, org-shared ads
  │     └── AdLibraryItem                      ← creative + metadata
  └── Project                                  ← isolated workspace
        ├── Advertiser → Campaign → Flight → Ad → Creative
        ├── Channel → Site → Zone              ← inventory
        ├── Priority                           ← waterfall tier
        ├── AdType                             ← format/size identifier
        └── CreativeTemplate                   ← native-ad value schema
```

The inventory chain (Channel → Site → Zone) and demand chain (Advertiser →
Campaign → Flight → Ad → Creative) are unchanged from Kevel; the
top-level grouping is renamed (Project) and bumped under an Org, and
an org-scoped Ad Library is added alongside.

### 5.1 Ad Library

An Org-scoped catalog of reusable ad content. Each `AdLibraryItem`
carries a creative (image, html, or native template values) plus
catalog metadata (name, description, default ad type hints).

Project-scoped `Ad` rows take one of two shapes (a `oneOf` in the
spec):

- **Inline** — embeds a project-local `creativeId` directly. The
  current/default shape; what you use when the ad lives entirely
  within one project.
- **Reference** — `{ adLibraryItemId: ... }` instead of
  `creativeId`. The Ad inherits the library item's creative content
  at decision time. The Project supplies the flight binding,
  weight, and Project-scoped advertiser context.

This solves cross-project ad reuse without duplicating data: one
library item, many references. Decision-time resolution is O(1)
through the in-memory snapshot. When a library item is updated, all
references see the new content (after the next snapshot swap).

Every persistable entity carries:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Server-assigned, project-scoped (or org-scoped for orgs/projects). |
| `externalId` | string \| null | Caller-assigned, unique within `(project, resource)`. |
| `etag` | string | Opaque concurrency token for `If-Match`. |
| `createdAt` | RFC 3339 | |
| `updatedAt` | RFC 3339 | |
| `isActive` | bool | Soft-delete via `isActive: false`; v0 has no hard delete. |

Sites additionally carry:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | string | Unique within the project (across `url` + `aliases`). |
| `aliases` | string[] | Additional URLs that resolve to this site. |

The Decision API can resolve a placement's site by `siteId`, `siteUrl`,
or `siteExternalId`. URL lookup matches `url` and `aliases`.

## 6. API Surface (v0)

OpenAPI 3.1, served at `/openapi.json`. Bearer auth. Cursor pagination.
`Idempotency-Key` documented as part of the spec. Path-prefixed:

- `/v1/orgs/{orgId}/...` — org-level operations (provisioning, tokens,
  members).
- `/v1/projects/{projectId}/...` — everything else (resources, decisions).
- `/e/...` — public event tracking (HMAC-signed, no auth).
- `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/openapi.json`, `/version` — system.

Full endpoint list, request/response shapes, and conventions live in
`API.md`.

### 6.1 Decision API summary

`POST /v1/projects/{projectId}/decisions`

```json
{
  "context": {
    "url":       "https://example.com/article/42",
    "referrer":  "https://www.google.com/...",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 ..."
  },
  "placements": [
    {
      "id":      "header",
      "siteUrl": "https://example.com",
      "zoneIds": [34],
      "adTypes": [16],
      "count":   1
    }
  ],
  "block": {
    "creativeIds":   [],
    "advertiserIds": [],
    "campaignIds":   []
  }
}
```

Selection algorithm:

1. Filter to flights active at request time (date window).
2. Filter to ads matching `siteId`/`zoneIds`/`adTypes`.
3. Apply `force.*` overrides (debug only; not for production traffic).
4. Apply `block.*` exclusions (caller-derived state).
5. Group by priority tier; highest non-empty tier wins.
6. Within tier: weighted random by ad weight.
7. Mint HMAC-signed click and impression URLs.

`decisions[<id>]` is always an array. Empty = no eligible ad. `creative`
is a typed `oneOf` (image / html / native).

`context` fields are informational: stored on event rows, available to
future URL-pattern targeting; never used for tenant routing (the project
ID in the path is the only authoritative tenant signal).

`block` is the post-filter exclusion set. Knievel doesn't model the
caller's domain (subscription state, archival, etc.); the caller computes
the blocklist and passes it.

### 6.2 Management API summary

Full CRUD plus bulk-upsert for the demand and inventory chains:

| Resource | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| Advertiser | CRUD + `:batchUpsert` |
| Campaign | CRUD + `:batchUpsert` |
| Flight | CRUD + `:batchUpsert` |
| Ad | CRUD + `:batchUpsert` |
| Creative | CRUD + image upload |
| CreativeTemplate | CRUD |
| Site | CRUD + `:batchUpsert` + `:upsertByUrl` |
| Zone | CRUD + `:batchUpsert` |

Read-only inventory taxonomy (per-project but rarely changed):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| Channel | List, Get |
| Priority | List, Get |
| AdType | List, Get |

All write endpoints accept `Idempotency-Key`. Bulk upserts are atomic
per batch and keyed on `externalId`. Sites' `:upsertByUrl` is a
first-class natural-key endpoint for URL-driven flows.

### 6.3 Event tracking

- `GET /e/i/{signed}` — impression. `204 No Content` (or 1×1 GIF if
  `?fmt=gif`).
- `GET /e/c/{signed}` — click. `302` to the creative's
  `clickThroughUrl`.

HMAC-SHA256 signatures over `(project_id, ad_id, creative_id,
placement_id_hash, issued_at, nonce)` with a per-project secret. TTL
configurable per project (default 24 h).

The per-project secret is **server-generated** at project creation
(via `crypto.rand_bytes`); the operator never supplies one. Rotation
via `PATCH /v1/orgs/{orgId}/projects/{projectId}` keeps the previous
secret valid as a verifier for **8 hours** so already-minted
impression/click URLs continue to work during the overlap. After the
overlap, only the new secret is accepted. Documented in `AUTH.md`
and surfaced as a one-line warning in the rotation endpoint's
response.

### 6.4 API compatibility policy

The OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.json` is the contract. The policy is
"additive forever" — new minor and patch versions never break old
clients — with explicit rules:

| Change | Allowed without major bump? |
|---|---|
| New endpoint | ✅ |
| New optional request field, header, or query param | ✅ |
| New response field | ✅ (clients must ignore unknown fields; the generated gem already does) |
| Adding to a `oneOf` / discriminated union | ✅ (clients fall through on unknown variants; generated gem treats as `Unknown`) |
| New error codes | ✅ (clients are advised to treat unknown codes the same as the next-broader category) |
| New required request field | ❌ |
| Changing the meaning or type of an existing field | ❌ |
| Removing a field | ❌ until it's been marked deprecated for ≥ 6 months |
| Removing or renaming an endpoint | ❌ until it's been marked deprecated for ≥ 6 months |
| Changing default values | ❌ if it changes behavior; ✅ if it only fills in something that was previously required |
| Changing HTTP status codes returned for an existing error category | ❌ |

Deprecations carry HTTP `Deprecation: true` and `Sunset:
<RFC-3339-date>` response headers, are listed in the OpenAPI spec
as `deprecated: true`, and are called out in release notes.

#### Generated client compatibility

The Ruby gem's version mirrors the server's published spec
version: gem `X.Y.Z` is generated from server spec `X.Y` and is
**compatible with any server `>= X.Y`**. Patch versions are
gem-internal (helper changes, dependency bumps).

Compatibility matrix RX (and other consumers) can rely on:

- gem `X.Y.*` ↔ server `X.Y`, `X.(Y+1)`, `X.(Y+2)`, … all work.
- gem `X.Y.*` ↔ server `X.(Y-1)` does **not** work — the gem may
  reference fields the older server didn't emit.
- gem `X.0.*` ↔ server `(X-1).*` does **not** work — major bumps
  imply removed or renamed surface.

In practice major bumps are rare; `X` stays at `0` through v0 and
moves to `1` when the surface stabilizes. Until then, every release
is treated as a minor bump under the same additive rules.

## 7. Storage

Knievel is Postgres-native and **vanilla**. It targets a single schema
(default `knievel`) inside operator-supplied Postgres. The only
required extension is `pgcrypto`. Knievel manages its own partitions
in-process from a leader-elected tokio task — no `pg_partman`, no
external scheduler. This works on every major managed Postgres,
including the strict ones (Cloud SQL without bgw support, Supabase).
Minimum Postgres version: **14** (for `DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY`).

### 7.1 Schema and isolation

All knievel tables live in a single schema, default name `knievel`,
configurable per deployment. The schema is owned by a dedicated
Postgres role (`knievel_app`) with grants only on its own schema:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA knievel;
CREATE ROLE knievel_app LOGIN PASSWORD '...';
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA knievel TO knievel_app;
ALTER ROLE knievel_app SET search_path = knievel, public;
```

Knievel migrations only touch its own schema. The `_sqlx_migrations`
tracking table lives in `knievel` too.

Knievel runs against the cluster **writer endpoint** in shared-Aurora
deployments. `LISTEN/NOTIFY` does not propagate to readers; the
snapshot loader needs the writer. Reconnect-with-backoff handles
Aurora failovers.

All entities carry `(org_id, project_id)` columns. Isolation is
enforced at the query layer and via Postgres row-level security
policies (defense in depth). Both layers are **verified by tests
and CI gates** — see §7.1.1.

#### 7.1.1 Tenant isolation verification

Three mandatory gates, treated as release-blocking:

1. **Cross-tenant integration test suite.** For every project-scoped
   endpoint, a test exercises the negative case: a token issued for
   project A attempts to read or mutate project B and is asserted
   to receive `403 forbidden / wrong_project` (or `403 / wrong_tenant`
   when the org doesn't match). New project-scoped endpoints must
   ship with the matching test fixture; the test framework's helper
   makes adding one a one-liner per endpoint. CI fails if any
   `/v1/projects/{p}/...` endpoint is added without a corresponding
   cross-tenant test.

2. **Migration linter.** A CI check that scans every migration in
   `migrations/` and fails the build if it contains:
   - `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`
   - `ALTER TABLE ... NO FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`
   - Any `CREATE TABLE` in the `knievel` schema without a paired
     `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` statement.
   - Any `CREATE POLICY` whose `USING` clause doesn't reference
     `current_setting('knievel.project_id')` (or equivalent
     session-scoped tenant binding).
   The linter is a small Rust binary in `xtask`, run by `cargo
   xtask lint-migrations`, executed as a CI step.

3. **Release security checklist.** Tagging a release requires a
   maintainer to check off, in writing in the release PR:
   - All cross-tenant integration tests pass.
   - Migration linter passes.
   - Manual review of any auth-config or RLS-policy changes since
     the previous tag.
   - No new endpoints accept tenant identity from the request body
     (only path or token-derived).
   - No new logging adds PII (no raw user-agent strings, no IP
     addresses outside `events_raw`, no JWT contents in logs).

   The checklist lives in `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` and is enforced as
   a required PR comment on the release-tagging PR. Skipping any
   item requires a brief written justification in the same PR.

These three together turn "RLS as defense in depth" from intent into
verifiable property. Catastrophic regressions (a migration that
quietly drops RLS, an endpoint that takes `org_id` from the body) get
caught in CI before reaching review.

### 7.2 Configuration store

Source of truth for all knievel-managed entities. Mutated only via the
Management API. Cold-start hydration is one query per table.

**Refresh strategy: notify + version-poll.** Each mutation increments
a monotonic `config_version` row in a small bookkeeping table and
emits a `NOTIFY config_changed`. The snapshot loader:

1. Subscribes to `LISTEN config_changed` on a long-lived writer
   connection. On notify, pulls the diff since the snapshot's
   current version and atomically swaps in the new snapshot.
2. Independently polls `SELECT config_version` every 5 s as a
   backstop. If the DB version has advanced beyond the snapshot's
   without a corresponding `NOTIFY` (Postgres' NOTIFY queue can
   drop messages under load, and Aurora failovers drop in-flight
   listeners), the poll picks up the divergence and triggers the
   same diff-pull path.

Either trigger results in the same atomic snapshot swap. Worst-case
staleness is bounded by the poll interval (5 s) regardless of NOTIFY
behavior.

The in-memory snapshot is keyed by `(project_id, resource)` so a
single process can serve thousands of small Projects efficiently.

### 7.3 Events

Two tables:

- **`events_raw`** — append-only, range-partitioned by day on `ts`.
  Declared via standard Postgres declarative partitioning (`PARTITION
  BY RANGE (ts)`); leaf partitions follow the naming convention
  `events_raw_p<YYYY_MM_DD>`. Columns: `ts`, `org_id`, `project_id`,
  `kind` (`decision` | `impression` | `click`), `placement_id`,
  `site_id`, `zone_id`, `ad_id`, `creative_id`, `flight_id`,
  `campaign_id`, `advertiser_id`, `url`, `referrer_host`,
  `user_agent_hash`, `signature_nonce`, `dedup_key`, `snapshot_version`.
  **Default
  retention 30 days** (conservative because backups are the operator's
  responsibility in shared-DB deployments); operator-configurable.
- **`events_rollup`** — hourly aggregates by `(project_id, site_id,
  zone_id, flight_id, ad_id, creative_id, kind)`, counting only
  non-duplicate rows. Computed by a periodic job before raw
  partitions age out. Indefinite retention.
- **`audit_log`** — separate from event tables. One row per
  privileged or sensitive operation: `force.*` decision overrides,
  HMAC-secret rotation, project deletion, member role changes, token
  mint/revoke. Columns: `ts`, `org_id`, `project_id`, `actor`
  (`(iss, sub, azp)` from JWT, or token name for opaque),
  `operation`, `payload_hash`, `reason`, `request_id`. Append-only,
  365-day retention by default, partitioned monthly.

Partition policy:

- **Premake = 4 days.** Maintenance always ensures 4 days of future
  partitions exist. With hourly maintenance, a leader outage of up to
  ~4 days is harmless.
- **No default partition.** A failed `COPY` due to a missing partition
  is a loud signal that maintenance is broken; we want the alert, not
  a silent catch-all that silently corrupts the time-series index.

### 7.4 Partition manager (in-process, leader-elected)

Knievel ships a small partition manager — roughly 100 lines of Rust —
running on a single elected leader pod. Behaviour per maintenance
tick (default hourly):

1. For each day in `[today, today + premake]`, ensure the leaf
   partition exists:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS knievel.events_raw_p2026_05_10
     PARTITION OF knievel.events_raw
     FOR VALUES FROM ('2026-05-10') TO ('2026-05-11');
   ```
2. List existing leaf partitions of `events_raw` from `pg_inherits` +
   `pg_class`, parse the date from the name, and detach + drop any
   whose upper bound is older than `today − retention_days`:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE knievel.events_raw DETACH PARTITION
     knievel.events_raw_p2026_04_01 CONCURRENTLY;
   DROP TABLE knievel.events_raw_p2026_04_01;
   ```
3. Emit a structured log entry and a metric per run with counts of
   partitions created and dropped.

Leader election uses a Postgres session-level advisory lock held on a
dedicated long-lived connection (see §7.5). When the leader's session
ends — graceful shutdown, crash, or Aurora failover — the lock is
released automatically and a follower acquires it on its next poll
(default 30 s).

The same leader runs other small periodic jobs (rollup compute,
idempotency-key reaper, token last-used flush) so we don't pay for N
leader elections.

### 7.5 Leader election

Implemented with `pg_try_advisory_lock(MAGIC_KEY, schema_oid)` on a
dedicated connection separate from the query and flusher pools.
Properties:

- **Crash-safe.** Session ends → lock auto-released. No heartbeats, no
  expiry math, no split-brain.
- **Connection IS the lease.** Reconnect = re-elect. Pod restart = lock
  released by Postgres immediately.
- **Bounded failover.** ≤ 30 s between leader loss and successor.
- **Watchdog.** Leader asserts "must complete a maintenance run every
  N hours"; failure exits the process (which releases the lock and
  forces re-election). Same condition is reflected in `/readyz`.

### 7.6 Write path

Per-request DB I/O is forbidden on the hot path. Events go to a
bounded `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel. A flusher task drains every 1–2 s
(or 5 k events, whichever first) and `COPY`s into the parent
`knievel.events_raw` table — Postgres routes each row to the
appropriate partition by `ts`. Channel saturation surfaces as `503` on
the decision endpoint rather than silent loss. Failures are reported
to Sentry with the batch size and offending row sample.

### 7.7 Migrations

Plain SQL files in `migrations/`, embedded into the binary via
`sqlx::migrate!()`. Run on startup behind `KNIEVEL_AUTO_MIGRATE=true`,
or via `knievel-cli migrate`. All files start with
`SET search_path TO knievel, public;` so migrations are
schema-targeted regardless of session defaults.

### 7.8 Connection budget

Knievel competes with the host application for the cluster's
connection pool. Per knievel instance, default budget:

- **1** long-lived `LISTEN` connection (writer endpoint, snapshot loader).
- **1** long-lived advisory-lock connection on every pod (the leader's
  connection holds the lock; followers' connections poll). Held in the
  pool but not returned.
- **8** query pool connections (sqlx default), env-overridable.
- **2** dedicated event-flusher connections for `COPY`.

Total ≈ **12** per instance. Operators with pgbouncer in front of
Aurora should size accordingly.

### 7.9 Image storage

Knievel stores creative image assets in an **S3-compatible object
store** by default. Operators configure the endpoint, bucket, and
credentials; AWS S3, MinIO, R2, GCS-via-S3-compat, and on-prem
equivalents all work without code changes.

Upload constraints (defaults; operator-tunable):

- **Max size:** 40 MB per image.
- **Allowed MIME types:** `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`,
  `image/webp`, `image/avif`. SVG is **not** accepted (script-execution
  risk in the rendering page); HEIC/HEIF is not accepted (limited
  browser support); BMP/TIFF are not accepted (legacy, oversized).
- **Validation:** server sniffs the magic bytes and verifies they
  match the declared MIME type; mismatch is `415 Unsupported Media
  Type`. Files are stored with their content-type set so CDNs serve
  them correctly.
- **Naming:** stored under
  `{bucket}/projects/{project_id}/creatives/{creative_id}/{uuid}.{ext}`.
  Returned `imageUrl` is signed (or unsigned, public-read) per
  operator config.
- **No virus scanning in v0.** Operators that need it wrap the
  upload endpoint with their own scanner. Documented as a known gap.

Local-disk and Postgres-bytea backends are roadmap items; v0 is
S3-only to keep the scope honest.

### 7.10 Reporting and downstream analytics

Reporting is a primary motivation for knievel, not an afterthought.
The data model is shaped to be friendly to downstream warehousing
and dbt-style transformations:

- **Same database, different schema.** `knievel.events_raw`,
  `knievel.events_rollup`, and the dimensional tables
  (`knievel.advertisers`, `knievel.campaigns`, etc.) live in the
  same Postgres cluster as the operator's existing analytics
  tables. dbt models can `JOIN` across schemas freely; no ETL hop.
- **Append-only events.** `events_raw` never updates rows in place;
  bronze-layer materializations are simple incremental models
  keyed on `ts`.
- **Partition pruning is automatic.** Daily range partitions on
  `ts` mean an `events_raw` query filtered to the last day touches
  one partition; a 30-day query touches 30. No secondary indexes on
  `events_raw` (would slow `COPY` ingest); partition pruning is
  enough for dbt-scale workloads.
- **Typed columns, no JSON.** Every event field is a typed column;
  no JSON unpacking in dbt models.
- **A read-only role for the warehouse.** `knievel_reader` (granted
  to the dbt service account or analytics tooling) gets `SELECT` on
  `knievel.*` and nothing else. Knievel never reads from this role;
  it exists purely for downstream consumers.
- **`events_rollup` is a starting point**, not the only path.
  Knievel computes hourly rollups for self-contained reporting; dbt
  pipelines may reuse them as a faster bronze layer or compute their
  own gold tables directly from `events_raw`.

Concrete dbt integration patterns, role grants, and sample models
live in `REPORTING.md`.

### 7.11 What's deferred

- **Redis** — only needed when frequency capping or per-user pacing
  ships.
- **TimescaleDB / ClickHouse** — escape hatches if/when partitioned
  Postgres stops keeping up. Not v0.

## 8. Deliverables

1. **`knievel`** Rust binary — server, snapshot loader, event flusher,
   partition maintenance task, migrations.
2. **`openapi.yaml`** — generated from the binary by `cargo xtask
   openapi`, committed to the repo, served at `/openapi.json`.
3. **Generated client libraries + idiomatic wrapper.** At minimum a
   Ruby gem (`knievel-ruby`), generated via `openapi-generator-cli` in
   CI and published on tag. The generated code is the transport
   layer; the gem additionally ships hand-written `Resource` wrappers
   that turn list operations into `Enumerable` objects backed by
   cursor pagination. List endpoints in the OpenAPI spec are marked
   with an `x-knievel-paginated` vendor extension, which the wrapper
   keys off of. Result: idiomatic Ruby use including `each`,
   `each_page`, `lazy`, `first(n)`, and short-circuiting iteration —
   all without the caller writing pagination loops. Other languages
   on demand; each lang ships a comparable wrapper.
4. **`knievel-cli`** — admin CLI for project provisioning, token
   rotation, snapshot inspection, migration replay, and **`seed-demo`**
   (populates a fresh knievel install with a sample org, project,
   advertisers, flights, ads, and creatives so a contributor can
   issue meaningful decisions immediately). Shares the OpenAPI client.
5. **Container image** — minimal distroless or `gcr.io/distroless/cc`
   based, multi-arch (`amd64` + `arm64`), published on tag.
6. **Helm chart** (`charts/knievel`) — first-class deployment artifact,
   not an afterthought. See §8.1.
7. **Compose manifest** — single-binary + bring-your-own-Postgres for
   local development and reference single-node deployments.

Per-consumer migration guides (e.g., `MIGRATION_RX.md`) live alongside
the spec but are not part of the v0 platform deliverable surface.

### 8.1 Helm chart

`values.yaml` exposes a high-level idiomatic shape; the chart's
templates render those values into a `config.yaml` and mount it as a
ConfigMap. The Deployment carries a `checksum/config` annotation
computed from the rendered ConfigMap so any values change rolls the
pods.

Sketch of the values surface:

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/xrl/knievel
  tag: ""               # defaults to chart appVersion
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

replicaCount: 2

  limits:   { cpu: 2,    memory: 1Gi }

  capabilities: { drop: [ALL] }

nodeSelector: {}
tolerations: []

```

Templates render values into a single mounted file at
`/etc/knievel/config.yaml`. Secrets (DSNs, DB passwords) are resolved
via `existingSecret` references and projected as env vars; the
`config.yaml` references them via `${VAR}` interpolation rather than
embedding their plaintext.

Key chart conventions:

- `checksum/config` pod annotation = `sha256sum` of the rendered
  ConfigMap. Helm chart upgrade with new values triggers a rollout.
- Resource names follow `{{ include "knievel.fullname" . }}`; standard
  Helm labels (`app.kubernetes.io/...`) on every resource.
- Optional `ServiceMonitor` for Prometheus Operator users.
- `helm template` output validated in CI with `helm lint` and
  `kubeconform`.

**HA across availability zones.** Knievel is single-region in v0,
but operators running multi-AZ clusters should spread replicas
across zones. The chart exposes `affinity` as raw values so any
shape works; the chart README walks through the standard
`topologySpreadConstraints` recipe (`topologyKey:
topology.kubernetes.io/zone`, `whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule`,
`maxSkew: 1`) plus a soft `podAntiAffinity` on the same key. Sample
values block ships in the README so new operators can copy-paste
without learning Kubernetes-API internals.

## 9. Performance and Capacity Envelope

### 9.1 Target SLOs (unmeasured; aspirational)

These are the SLOs we design toward. **They are not measured
numbers.** The capacity envelope below specifies how we'll verify
them and what to watch in the meantime.

Single node, 4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM, 100 k active flights:

- p50 decision latency ≤ **1 ms** (1 placement, no overrides).
- p99 decision latency ≤ **10 ms** (4 placements).
- Sustained throughput ≥ **20 000 decisions/sec** before saturating
  one core.
- Cold-start to first decision served ≤ **2 s**.
- Event flusher keeps end-to-end ingest lag ≤ **3 s** at peak.

### 9.2 Measurement protocol

Verified per major release that touches the hot path
(decision selection, snapshot loader, event flusher) before tagging:

- **Load generator:** [`vegeta`](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)
  or `k6`. Synthetic project with 100 k active flights drawn from a
  realistic distribution (priority tiers, weights, targeting
  predicates).
- **Workload:** mixed read (90% decision) + write (10% management
  CRUD) at increasing concurrency until p99 breaches the SLO.
- **DB substrate:** matches the deployment's expected Postgres
  class. RX-style measurements use Aurora Postgres r6g.large or
  comparable; community measurements use a self-hosted Postgres on
  comparable hardware.
- **Reportable artifact:** committed to `bench/results/<version>.md`
  with knievel SHA, DB class, achieved QPS, achieved latency
  percentiles, and observed bottleneck. Numbers in §9.1 are updated
  to reflect the measured floor.

Until §9.1 numbers are validated by an entry in `bench/results/`,
docs and dashboards label them as **TARGET (unverified)**.

### 9.3 Operator alert thresholds

Independent of benchmark numbers, these thresholds are actionable
today off the metrics described in §10.5:

| Signal | Warn | Critical | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `knievel_decision_duration_seconds` p99 | 2× SLO (20 ms) | 5× SLO (50 ms) | Investigate snapshot age, DB latency, queue depth. |
| `knievel_event_channel_depth / channel_capacity` | 50 % | 80 % | DB writer slow or down; scale flusher connections or DB tier. |
| `knievel_event_flush_lag_seconds` | 10 s | 30 s | DB writer saturation; same as above. |
| `knievel_snapshot_age_seconds` | 60 s | 300 s | NOTIFY queue / failover; check DB replication lag and writer endpoint. |
| `knievel_partition_maintenance_seconds_since_last` | 6 h | 24 h | Leader health; check `/readyz` and watchdog. |
| Postgres `pg_stat_activity` connection count for `knievel_app` | 80 % of pool | 95 % | Pool exhaustion; tune `max_connections` or scale pods. |

### 9.4 Scaling decision tree

When an SLO trips, the order of operations:

1. **Latency degraded?** Inspect snapshot age + DB latency
   percentiles. Stale snapshot → snapshot loader is the bottleneck;
   investigate NOTIFY/poll path. DB-bound → scale read or writer
   tier.
2. **Throughput degraded?** Look at CPU utilization on knievel pods
   *before* scaling pods. Hot-path is RAM-bound, not DB-bound; CPU
   saturation suggests scaling out is the right move.
3. **Event ingest lagging?** Check channel depth + flush batch
   sizes. Channel near capacity = flusher can't keep up; scale DB
   writer tier (this isn't a knievel-pod scaling problem).
4. **Backups bloating?** `events_raw` is partitioned; reduce
   `events.retention_days` (cuts retained data quickly because the
   oldest partitions drop next maintenance run).

Scaling out knievel pods is cheap (stateless except for the
advisory-lock leader, which re-elects in ≤ 30 s); scaling Postgres
is the real cost. Operators should bias toward "more pods, same
DB" up to the connection budget, then "bigger DB."

### 9.5 What's measured vs. what's targeted

Until benchmarks land:

- §9.1 numbers carry a "TARGET (unverified)" caveat in the docs and
  in any dashboards we ship.
- §9.3 alert thresholds are operator-actionable today regardless of
  benchmarking status.
- The first release that touches the hot path produces a
  `bench/results/v0.1.md` artifact; subsequent releases append.

## 10. Operational

### 10.1 Configuration

Layered, in order of precedence (later wins):

1. Built-in defaults (compiled in).
2. `config.yaml` (path from `KNIEVEL_CONFIG`, default
   `/etc/knievel/config.yaml`).
3. Individual env-var overrides (`KNIEVEL_*`).

The `config.yaml` is preprocessed for `${VAR}` and `${VAR:default}`
interpolation before parse, so secrets injected as env vars (DB
password, Sentry DSN, HMAC key) can be referenced inline without
templating tools. `${VAR}` with an unset `VAR` and no default is a
hard error at startup.

`config.yaml` schema (illustrative; full schema lives in code +
`config.example.yaml`):

```yaml
api:
  bind_addr: 0.0.0.0:8080
  public_base_url: https://ads.example.com

database:
  url: postgres://knievel_app:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}/${DB_NAME}?sslmode=require
  schema: knievel
  max_connections: 8
  flusher_connections: 2
  auto_migrate: false

events:
  retention_days: 30
  flush_interval_ms: 1000
  flush_batch_size: 5000

hmac:
  default_secret: ${KNIEVEL_HMAC_DEFAULT_SECRET}

logging:
  level: info
  format: json
  decisions_sample_rate: 0.01

tracing:
  otel:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}
    service_name: knievel
    resource_attributes:
      deployment.environment: ${KNIEVEL_ENV:production}

errors:
  sentry:
    enabled: true
    dsn: ${SENTRY_DSN:}
    environment: ${KNIEVEL_ENV:production}
    release: ${KNIEVEL_RELEASE:}
    sample_rate: 1.0
```

Loading is done with `figment` layering the three sources. Empty
`sentry.dsn` is permitted and disables the integration — keeps dev
runs from needing a Sentry project.

### 10.2 Logging

Structured JSON via `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber::fmt::json()`.
Every line includes `timestamp`, `level`, `target`, `message`,
`request_id`, and (when in a span) `trace_id` + `span_id` from the
OTel context.

Per-context fields attached at request entry:

- `org_id`, `project_id`, `route`, `method`, `status`, `duration_ms`
- For decision requests: `placement_count`, `decision_outcome` (hit /
  miss / blocked / forced), `snapshot_version`
- For management writes: `resource`, `external_id`, `idempotent_replay`

Decision endpoint logs are sampled at `decisions_sample_rate` (default
1%); errors and 4xx/5xx always log fully, regardless of sample.

### 10.3 Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)

`opentelemetry` + `opentelemetry-otlp` (gRPC) + `opentelemetry-sdk`
+ `tracing-opentelemetry` bridging from `tracing`. Spans:

- One per HTTP request, with HTTP semantic conventions.
- One per snapshot refresh cycle.
- One per event flush batch (with `batch_size` and `partition_count`
  attributes).
- One per outbound DB call (via `sqlx` instrumentation).

Trace context propagated via standard W3C `traceparent` header.
Exported to whatever OTLP endpoint the operator configures (Tempo,
Honeycomb, Datadog Agent, Grafana Cloud, etc.). Sampling is
tail-based at the collector; knievel always emits.

### 10.4 Error reporting (Sentry)

`sentry` Rust SDK + `sentry-tower` HTTP middleware (per-request hub
with auto-attached scope) + `sentry-tracing` (forwards `tracing`
events as breadcrumbs and elevates `ERROR` to Sentry exceptions).
Panic capture is enabled at boot.

What gets reported:

- All unhandled errors that surface as `5xx` responses.
- Panics (with full backtrace).
- Non-panic `tracing::error!()` calls — including event-flusher
  failures, snapshot-load failures, partition-missing errors.
- Migration failures at startup.

Per-request scope automatically attaches:

- `request_id`, `org_id`, `project_id`, `route`, `method`
- Sanitized request headers (no `Authorization`)
- Token name (not the secret) when present

Sentry DSN is optional in config; missing DSN disables reporting
entirely (useful for local dev). Sentry is for errors only;
performance/tracing live in OTel.

### 10.5 Metrics

Prometheus exposition at `/metrics`. **Default cardinality is low**:
no `project_id` label on counters or histograms. Per-tenant
granularity lives in traces (high cardinality is fine there) and
sampled logs (already structured with `project_id`).

Default series (operator-friendly, ~10² series total regardless of
project count):

- `knievel_decision_requests_total{outcome}` — outcome ∈
  {`hit`, `miss`, `blocked`, `forced`, `error`}.
- `knievel_decision_duration_seconds` (histogram).
- `knievel_event_flush_batch_size` (histogram).
- `knievel_event_channel_depth` (gauge).
- `knievel_event_channel_dropped_total{reason}` (counter).
- `knievel_snapshot_age_seconds` (gauge).
- `knievel_partition_maintenance_runs_total{result}` (counter).
- `knievel_partition_maintenance_seconds_since_last` (gauge).
- `knievel_partitions_created_total`, `_dropped_total` (counters).
- `knievel_maintenance_leader` (gauge, this pod's leadership state).
- standard `process_*`, `tokio_*`, `sqlx_pool_*`.

**Per-project metrics are opt-in.** When a specific project needs
investigation, the operator adds it to
`metrics.per_project_projects: ["pj_AbCd...", "pj_EfGh..."]` in
config and redeploys. While listed, knievel emits a parallel set of
labeled series (`knievel_decision_requests_total{project_id="pj_…",
outcome}`, etc.) only for those projects. Removing the project from
the list stops the emission. This caps per-tenant cardinality at
deliberate, operator-controlled investigations rather than all
projects forever.

Per-tenant breakdowns for routine analysis live in:

- **Traces (OTel)** — every span carries `project_id` /
  `org_id` as attributes; backends like Tempo, Honeycomb, Datadog
  index them efficiently and are designed for the cardinality.
- **Sampled logs** — JSON log lines include `project_id` /
  `org_id`; aggregations live in the log backend (Loki, Splunk,
  CloudWatch Logs Insights), not Prometheus.

The default-low policy means "graph cluster health" works with
plain Prometheus + Grafana on day one; "graph this one project
right now" is a config flip away.

### 10.6 Health and readiness

- `/healthz` — liveness. `200` if the process is running.
- `/readyz` — readiness. `200` only if (a) snapshot has loaded once,
  (b) DB writer is reachable, (c) event flusher hasn't deadlocked,
  (d) some pod (this one or another) reports a successful partition
  maintenance run within the last 24 h.

### 10.7 Graceful shutdown

On SIGTERM:

1. Stop accepting new connections (HTTP `Connection: close`).
2. Drain in-flight requests up to `shutdown_drain_timeout` (default
   30 s).
3. Flush the event channel — final `COPY` of all buffered events.
4. Close DB connections, OTel exporter, Sentry transport (with
   their own bounded flush deadlines).
5. Exit.

Total budget bounded by `shutdown_total_timeout` (default 60 s).

### 10.8 Database migrations

`sqlx-cli`-style: plain SQL files in `migrations/`, embedded via
`sqlx::migrate!()`. Run on startup if `database.auto_migrate: true`,
or via `knievel-cli migrate`. All migrations target the configured
schema and are idempotent at the migration-runner level (`_sqlx_migrations`).

### 10.9 Degraded mode behavior

When part of the stack fails, knievel's behavior is contractual —
not best-effort. The matrix below specifies what callers see, the
status code returned, and the operator action.

| Failure mode | Detection signal | API behavior | Status | Caller retry guidance | Operator action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DB writer unreachable** | `sqlx` pool errors on writes; `LISTEN` connection drops | Decision endpoint **continues serving** from in-memory snapshot; management writes fail; impression/click pings still work (events buffer in channel) | `503 / db_writer_unreachable` on writes; `200` on decisions and event pings | Backoff with jitter on writes; reads stay healthy | Check Aurora failover; the writer endpoint is the bottleneck |
| **Snapshot stale > warn threshold** (default 60 s) | `snapshot_age_seconds` > 60 | Decisions still served; response carries `X-Knievel-Stale-Snapshot: <age_seconds>` header; management reads also carry the header | `200` (read-only paths) | None — caller decides whether stale data is acceptable | Investigate NOTIFY queue depth, Aurora failover state, network reachability of writer endpoint |
| **Snapshot stale > critical** (default 300 s) | `snapshot_age_seconds` > 300 | Decisions still served (stale); `/readyz` returns 503 (k8s pulls pod from rotation); management writes fail | `503 / snapshot_critically_stale` on writes; `200` on decisions (with stale header) | Caller can keep trying decisions; writes need backoff | Same as above; this is operator-actionable |
| **Event channel saturation** | `event_channel_depth == channel_capacity` | Decision endpoint **fails fast** at 503 — events would otherwise drop silently. Pings (`/e/...`) still succeed at signature-verify level but may be dropped if the channel is fully wedged | `503 / event_channel_saturated` | Backoff with jitter; the cluster is over capacity | Scale DB writer tier; the flusher can't keep up |
| **Leader maintenance failure** (partition or rollup) | watchdog assertion: no successful run in `watchdog_hours` | Process exits with non-zero status; k8s reschedules; advisory lock released; another pod elects | n/a (process death is external) | n/a | `/readyz` reports the watchdog state; investigate the underlying SQL error in Sentry |
| **Idempotency cache miss / corruption** | Internal | Replays of `Idempotency-Key` produce a fresh execution rather than a cached response | `200`/`201` as if first call (effects are idempotent at the row level via `externalId`) | None | None — degrades gracefully; investigate if frequent |
| **Both auth modes misconfigured at boot** | Linter (§ AUTH.md) | Process refuses to start | n/a | n/a | Fix config, restart |
| **JWKS endpoint unreachable** | HTTP failure on cache refresh | Cached keys serve until TTL expires, then JWT validation starts failing for that issuer (other issuers unaffected); cache refresh attempts continue at backoff | `401` for tokens whose `kid` is missing | Use a token from another issuer or wait for JWKS to be reachable | Check IdP availability and network |
| **All Postgres connections exhausted** | `sqlx_pool_*` saturation | All endpoints return 503 except `/healthz` and `/metrics` | `503 / db_pool_exhausted` | Backoff with jitter | Scale connections, scale pods, or scale DB tier |

Two cross-cutting principles:

- **Reads degrade later than writes.** Decision serving is the
  hot path; it stays available as long as the in-memory snapshot
  exists, even when Postgres is wholly unreachable.
- **Failures surface, not silently drop.** Channel saturation
  returns 503; events never silently drop. Operator gets a
  signal; caller gets a backoff hint.

## 11. Roadmap (post-v0)

Order is rough; each item is independently shippable.

1. **Frequency capping** — Redis joins the stack.
2. **Custom-property targeting** — flight predicates over arbitrary
   key/value pairs supplied in the decision request.
3. **Geo / IP targeting** — MaxMind DB on the snapshot side.
4. **Day-parting** — per-flight schedule.
5. **eCPM auctions** — second-price clearing within auction priorities.
6. **Reporting API** — query the rollup table; queue/poll model for
   heavy reports.
7. **Browser-direct mode** — CORS, anonymous decision endpoint, bot
   filtering, rate limits.
8. **UserDB-equivalent** — opaque user keys, interests, opt-out, GDPR
   forget. Designed fresh.
9. **Webhooks** — flight exhausted, sync complete, etc.
10. **Site Group scoping** — Project members/tokens scoped to a subset
    of Sites for sub-tenant admin isolation.
11. **Cross-project broadcast upsert** — for ads that span many Projects
    in an Org.
12. **Custom event types** beyond impression/click (likes, shares, video
    quartiles).
13. **Web admin UI**.
14. **SSO / OIDC** for the admin UI.
15. **Write endpoints for Channel / Priority / AdType**.

## 12. Open Questions

Most of the questions raised during design have been resolved and
folded into the spec. The remaining few:

- **`poem-openapi` JSON Schema cross-reference** — `CreativeTemplate.schema`
  embeds a JSON Schema document; verify `poem-openapi` round-trips it
  through the generated OpenAPI without flattening or escaping. Spike
  before the first creative-templates endpoint lands.
- **Idempotency-Key TTL longer than 24 h** for batch sync jobs that
  retry across CI runs. 24 h is plenty for online retries; consider
  bumping to 7 days for `:batchUpsert` endpoints specifically.
- **JWT claim format default** (`object` vs `flat`). Both supported;
  `object` is the documented default. Reconfirm after first integration
  uses it in anger.

### Resolved (folded in earlier)

- Snapshot refresh: notify + version-poll (5 s backstop). §7.2.
- Image hosting: S3-compatible default, 40 MB max, allow-list
  `image/{jpeg,png,gif,webp,avif}`. §7.9.
- `CreativeTemplate.schema`: JSON Schema. §6.
- Cross-project ads: org-scoped Ad Library; project Ads can inline a
  creative or reference a library item. §5.1.
- Admin UI auth: SSO/OIDC only, no local accounts. §11 roadmap.
- Cursor encoding: HMAC-signed blob over `(last_id, last_ts)`.
- HMAC secret rotation: 8-hour overlap during which `n` and `n-1`
  both verify. §6.3 / `AUTH.md`.
- Member removal does **not** auto-revoke their tokens; documented
  loudly. Tokens time out by their own expiry.
- JWT principal (`iss`, `sub`, `azp`) included in tracing/log fields
  and Sentry scope; mapping to humans is the operator's job. §10.
- Migrations auto-run at startup; impactful migrations called out in
  release notes for operator coordination.
- Cold-start ordering: migrate → load snapshot → start partition
  election → accept requests, all reflected in `/readyz`.
- API versioning: additive-forever with explicit rules and
  deprecation windows; OpenAPI is the contract. §6.4.
- `ads:upsertWithFlightAndCreative` stays a self-healing gem helper
  (no wire-side transaction).
- Empty decision arrays count toward request volume for billing /
  pacing purposes.
- Project HMAC secret server-generated at project creation. §6.3.
- `knievel-cli seed-demo` for new contributor installs.
- Multi-AZ HA via Helm `topologySpreadConstraints` documented in
  chart README. §8.1.
- DR / RPO targets explicitly out of scope; inherit from the host
  Postgres.
- Kubernetes ServiceAccount JWTs as a first-class auth mode, with
  per-issuer `claim_mapping` to derive principal from `sub`.
  `AUTH.md`.
